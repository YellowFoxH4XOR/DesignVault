Teach me about the topic in a professional, in-depth manner using the following structured approach. Ensure the response is educational, precise, and suitable for an audience with intermediate to advanced knowledge. Include the following sections: Background, Definition, Solution, Advantages, Limitations, Practical Implementation, and Example using [EXAMPLE]. If the topic doesn't naturally fit a section (e.g., non-technical subjects), adapt it logicallyâ€”such as renaming "Solution" to "Core Mechanism" or providing a brief note on why it's omitted. Use clear, concise language with step-by-step explanations. Incorporate simple ASCII diagrams, mathematical formulations (in LaTeX where appropriate), or descriptive visuals to illustrate key concepts; if visuals aren't applicable, explain why and use analogies instead. Avoid oversimplification; delve into underlying principles, potential edge cases, real-world implications, and any ethical considerations. If [EXAMPLE] is unsuitable or unavailable, suggest and use a relevant alternative. End with optional discussion questions to encourage deeper thinking. Ensure all facts are accurate and sourced where possible.
