## Key Patterns

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**Intent**: Enhance language models with external knowledge through retrieval mechanisms.

**Components**:
- **Retriever**: Finds relevant documents/information
- **Generator**: LLM that produces responses
- **Knowledge Base**: External information source

**When to Use**:
- Need up-to-date information beyond training data
- Domain-specific knowledge requirements
- Want to provide citations/sources

### Feature Store
**Intent**: Centralized repository for sharing and managing ML features across teams and models.

**Benefits**:
- Feature reusability across projects
- Consistent feature definitions
- Real-time and batch feature serving
- Feature lineage tracking

### Model Monitoring
**Intent**: Continuously track model performance and data quality in production.

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- **Performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Data Quality**: Missing values, outliers, schema changes
- **Drift**: Feature drift, target drift, concept drift
- **Infrastructure**: Latency, throughput, error rates

### Champion-Challenger
**Intent**: Safely test new model versions against the current production model.

**Implementation**:
```python
class ModelRouter:
    def __init__(self, champion_model, challenger_model, traffic_split=0.9):
        self.champion = champion_model
        self.challenger = challenger_model
        self.traffic_split = traffic_split
        
    def predict(self, features):
        if random.random() < self.traffic_split:
            prediction = self.champion.predict(features)
            model_used = 'champion'
        else:
            prediction = self.challenger.predict(features)
            model_used = 'challenger'
            
        # Log for comparison analysis
        self.log_prediction(features, prediction, model_used)
        return prediction
```

## AI System Architecture Patterns

### Lambda Architecture for ML
- **Batch Layer**: Historical data processing for model training
- **Speed Layer**: Real-time inference and online learning
- **Serving Layer**: Combine batch and real-time results

### Microservices for ML
- Model serving services
- Feature engineering services
- Data validation services
- Model monitoring services

## Implementation Guidelines

### Model Lifecycle Management
1. **Development**: Experimentation and training
2. **Staging**: Validation and testing
3. **Production**: Deployment and serving
4. **Monitoring**: Performance tracking
5. **Retirement**: Model deprecation

### Best Practices
- Version everything (data, code, models, configs)
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Use feature stores for consistency
- Design for model reproducibility
- Plan for concept drift
