## Key Patterns

### Distributed Tracing
**Intent**: Track requests as they flow through multiple services to understand system behavior and performance.

**Components**:
- **Trace**: Complete request journey
- **Span**: Individual operation within a trace
- **Context Propagation**: Pass trace information between services

**Benefits**:
- Root cause analysis for failures
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Service dependency mapping

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
// OpenTelemetry tracing
const { trace, context } = require('@opentelemetry/api');

const tracer = trace.getTracer('my-service');

async function processRequest(request) {
    const span = tracer.startSpan('process-request');
    
    try {
        // Set attributes
        span.setAttributes({
            'user.id': request.userId,
            'request.type': request.type
        });
        
        // Process request
        const result = await handleRequest(request);
        
        span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK });
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        span.recordException(error);
        span.setStatus({ 
            code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR, 
            message: error.message 
        });
        throw error;
    } finally {
        span.end();
    }
}
```

### Structured Logging
**Intent**: Use consistent, machine-readable log formats to enable automated processing and analysis.

**Benefits**:
- Easy parsing and querying
- Consistent format across services
- Better correlation capabilities
- Integration with log analysis tools

**Example Format**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "user-service",
  "traceId": "abc123",
  "spanId": "def456",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "userId": "12345",
  "duration": 150,
  "source": "auth-handler"
}
```

### Health Check API
**Intent**: Provide standardized endpoints for monitoring service health and dependencies.

**Health Check Levels**:
- **Liveness**: Is the service running?
- **Readiness**: Can the service handle requests?
- **Health**: Are dependencies available?

**Implementation**:
```javascript
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
    const health = {
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        checks: []
    };
    
    // Check database
    try {
        await database.ping();
        health.checks.push({ name: 'database', status: 'healthy' });
    } catch (error) {
        health.checks.push({ 
            name: 'database', 
            status: 'unhealthy', 
            error: error.message 
        });
        health.status = 'unhealthy';
    }
    
    const statusCode = health.status === 'healthy' ? 200 : 503;
    res.status(statusCode).json(health);
});
```

### Metrics Collection
**Intent**: Gather quantitative data about system performance and behavior.

**Metric Types**:
- **Counter**: Incrementing values (requests, errors)
- **Gauge**: Point-in-time values (CPU usage, memory)
- **Histogram**: Distribution of values (response times)
- **Summary**: Quantiles and totals

## The Three Pillars of Observability

### 1. Metrics
**What**: Numerical measurements over time
**Use**: Alerting, dashboards, capacity planning
**Examples**: Response time, error rate, throughput

### 2. Logs
**What**: Discrete events with context
**Use**: Debugging, audit trails, forensics
**Examples**: Application logs, access logs, error logs

### 3. Traces
**What**: Request flow across services
**Use**: Performance analysis, dependency mapping
**Examples**: Distributed traces, span data

## Implementation Guidelines

### Observability Strategy
1. **Start with the basics**: Metrics, logs, health checks
2. **Add distributed tracing**: For complex request flows
3. **Implement alerting**: For critical system issues
4. **Build dashboards**: For visual monitoring
5. **Practice chaos engineering**: Test resilience

### Best Practices
- **Consistent instrumentation**: Same patterns across services
- **Meaningful alerts**: Avoid alert fatigue
- **SLO-based monitoring**: Focus on user experience
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across boundaries
- **Retention policies**: Balance cost and compliance

### Common Anti-patterns
- **Over-monitoring**: Too many metrics without purpose
- **Alert fatigue**: Too many non-actionable alerts
- **Log spam**: Excessive verbose logging
- **Missing context**: Logs without correlation information
