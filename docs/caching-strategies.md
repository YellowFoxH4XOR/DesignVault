# Caching Strategies

Patterns for improving system performance through intelligent data caching. These 10 patterns help optimize data access and reduce latency.

## Pattern List

| # | Pattern | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Cache-Aside](#cache-aside) | Application manages cache explicitly |
| 2 | [Read-Through](#read-through) | Cache loads data automatically on miss |
| 3 | [Write-Through](#write-through) | Write to cache and database simultaneously |
| 4 | [Write-Behind](#write-behind) | Write to cache immediately, database asynchronously |
| 5 | [Write-Around](#write-around) | Write only to database, bypass cache |
| 6 | [Refresh-Ahead](#refresh-ahead) | Proactively refresh cache before expiration |
| 7 | [Near Cache](#near-cache) | Local cache close to application |
| 8 | [Distributed Cache](#distributed-cache) | Shared cache across multiple nodes |
| 9 | [Local Cache](#local-cache) | In-process cache within application |
| 10 | [Multi-level Cache](#multi-level-cache) | Hierarchical caching layers |

## Key Patterns

### Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)
**Intent**: Application explicitly manages cache loading and invalidation.

**Flow**:
1. Check cache for data
2. If miss, load from database
3. Store in cache for future requests

**When to Use**:
- Application has control over cache logic
- Complex cache invalidation rules
- Not all data needs caching

### Write-Through
**Intent**: Write operations update both cache and database synchronously.

**Benefits**:
- Data consistency between cache and database
- Cache always contains fresh data

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher write latency
- Unnecessary cache writes for rarely read data

### Distributed Cache
**Intent**: Share cached data across multiple application instances.

**Examples**: Redis, Memcached, Hazelcast

**Benefits**:
- Shared cache state
- Better cache hit ratios
- Horizontal scalability
