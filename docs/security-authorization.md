# Security & Authorization

Patterns for securing distributed systems and managing access control. These 15 patterns are essential for building secure, compliant applications.

## Pattern List

| # | Pattern | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Single Sign-On](#single-sign-on) | Centralized authentication across systems |
| 2 | [Role-Based Access Control](#role-based-access-control) | Permissions based on user roles |
| 3 | [Attribute-Based Access Control](#attribute-based-access-control) | Fine-grained access control using attributes |
| 4 | [OAuth](#oauth) | Delegated authorization framework |
| 5 | [JWT Token](#jwt-token) | Self-contained access tokens |
| 6 | [API Gateway](#api-gateway) | Centralized entry point with security |
| 7 | [Proxy Pattern](#proxy-pattern) | Intermediate security layer |
| 8 | [Firewall Pattern](#firewall-pattern) | Network-based access control |
| 9 | [Intrusion Detection](#intrusion-detection) | Monitor for malicious activity |
| 10 | [Encryption at Rest](#encryption-at-rest) | Protect stored data |
| 11 | [Encryption in Transit](#encryption-in-transit) | Protect data in motion |
| 12 | [Certificate Management](#certificate-management) | PKI and certificate lifecycle |
| 13 | [Key Management](#key-management) | Secure key storage and rotation |
| 14 | [Audit Logging](#audit-logging) | Track security-relevant events |
| 15 | [Security Monitoring](#security-monitoring) | Real-time threat detection |

## Key Patterns

### JWT Token
**Intent**: Use self-contained tokens that include claims about the user and can be verified without external lookups.

**Structure**:
- **Header**: Token type and algorithm
- **Payload**: Claims about the user
- **Signature**: Verify token integrity

**Benefits**:
- Stateless authentication
- Reduced database lookups
- Cross-domain compatibility

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Intent**: Grant permissions based on user roles rather than individual users.

**Components**:
- **Users**: Individuals accessing the system
- **Roles**: Collections of permissions
- **Permissions**: Specific actions or resources
- **Role Assignments**: Map users to roles

### API Gateway Security
**Intent**: Centralize security concerns at the system entry point.

**Security Functions**:
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response filtering
- SSL termination
- Audit logging

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Fail Secure**: Default to secure state on failure

### Best Practices
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper session management
- Validate all inputs
- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated
