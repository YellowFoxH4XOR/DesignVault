# Performance & Scalability

Patterns for optimizing system performance and enabling horizontal/vertical scaling. These 15 patterns help build high-performance distributed systems.

## Pattern List

| # | Pattern | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Horizontal Scaling](#horizontal-scaling) | Add more servers to handle increased load |
| 2 | [Vertical Scaling](#vertical-scaling) | Increase server capacity (CPU, RAM, storage) |
| 3 | [Database Connection Pooling](#database-connection-pooling) | Reuse database connections efficiently |
| 4 | [Thread Pool](#thread-pool) | Manage worker threads for concurrent processing |
| 5 | [Object Pool](#object-pool) | Reuse expensive objects to reduce allocation cost |
| 6 | [Lazy Loading](#lazy-loading) | Defer loading until data is actually needed |
| 7 | [Eager Loading](#eager-loading) | Preload related data to avoid N+1 queries |
| 8 | [Batch Processing](#batch-processing) | Process multiple items together for efficiency |
| 9 | [Stream Processing](#stream-processing) | Process data in real-time as it arrives |
| 10 | [Pipeline Pattern](#pipeline-pattern) | Break processing into sequential stages |
| 11 | [Producer-Consumer](#producer-consumer) | Decouple data production from consumption |
| 12 | [Master-Slave](#master-slave) | Distribute read load across slave instances |
| 13 | [Active-Passive](#active-passive) | Failover configuration for high availability |
| 14 | [Blue-Green Deployment](#blue-green-deployment) | Zero-downtime deployments |
| 15 | [Canary Deployment](#canary-deployment) | Gradual rollout to minimize risk |

## Key Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
**Intent**: Add more servers to distribute load rather than upgrading existing hardware.

**Benefits**:
- Better fault tolerance
- Cost-effective scaling
- No single point of failure

**Challenges**:
- Data consistency across nodes
- Increased complexity
- Network latency

### Database Connection Pooling
**Intent**: Maintain a pool of reusable database connections to avoid connection overhead.

**Implementation**:
```javascript
class ConnectionPool {
  constructor(maxConnections = 10) {
    this.maxConnections = maxConnections;
    this.availableConnections = [];
    this.usedConnections = new Set();
  }
  
  async getConnection() {
    if (this.availableConnections.length > 0) {
      const connection = this.availableConnections.pop();
      this.usedConnections.add(connection);
      return connection;
    }
    
    if (this.usedConnections.size < this.maxConnections) {
      const connection = await this.createConnection();
      this.usedConnections.add(connection);
      return connection;
    }
    
    // Wait for connection to become available
    return this.waitForConnection();
  }
  
  releaseConnection(connection) {
    this.usedConnections.delete(connection);
    this.availableConnections.push(connection);
  }
}
```

### Pipeline Pattern
**Intent**: Break complex processing into sequential stages for better throughput.

**Benefits**:
- Parallel processing of different stages
- Better resource utilization
- Easier to scale individual stages

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Response Time Optimization
- Use caching at multiple levels
- Minimize database queries
- Optimize algorithm complexity
- Use CDNs for static content

### Throughput Optimization
- Implement connection pooling
- Use batch processing
- Optimize database indexes
- Employ load balancing

### Resource Utilization
- Thread pool management
- Memory pool patterns
- CPU-bound vs I/O-bound optimization
- Resource monitoring and alerting
