# Concurrency & Coordination Patterns

Patterns for managing concurrent operations and coordinating distributed processes. These 20 patterns address synchronization, locking, and parallel processing challenges.

## Pattern List

| # | Pattern | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Optimistic Concurrency Control](#optimistic-concurrency-control) | Assume conflicts are rare, check before commit |
| 2 | [Pessimistic Concurrency Control](#pessimistic-concurrency-control) | Lock resources to prevent conflicts |
| 3 | [Lock-Free Programming](#lock-free-programming) | Coordinate without blocking operations |
| 4 | [Compare-and-Swap](#compare-and-swap) | Atomic conditional update operation |
| 5 | [Mutex Pattern](#mutex-pattern) | Mutual exclusion for critical sections |
| 6 | [Semaphore Pattern](#semaphore-pattern) | Control access to limited resources |
| 7 | [Reader-Writer Lock](#reader-writer-lock) | Allow multiple readers or single writer |
| 8 | [Barrier Synchronization](#barrier-synchronization) | Wait for all processes to reach checkpoint |
| 9 | [Thread-Safe Singleton](#thread-safe-singleton) | Ensure single instance in concurrent environment |
| 10 | [Actor Model](#actor-model) | Isolated actors communicating via messages |
| 11 | [Async/Await Pattern](#async-await-pattern) | Handle asynchronous operations sequentially |
| 12 | [Future/Promise Pattern](#future-promise-pattern) | Represent eventual result of async operation |
| 13 | [Reactor Pattern](#reactor-pattern) | Handle multiple I/O events simultaneously |
| 14 | [Proactor Pattern](#proactor-pattern) | Asynchronous I/O completion handling |
| 15 | [Worker Pool](#worker-pool) | Distribute tasks among worker processes |
| 16 | [Thread Pool](#thread-pool-concurrency) | Reuse threads for multiple tasks |
| 17 | [Fork-Join Pattern](#fork-join-pattern) | Split work and merge results |
| 18 | [MapReduce Pattern](#mapreduce-pattern) | Parallel processing of large datasets |
| 19 | [Distributed Locking](#distributed-locking) | Coordinate access across multiple nodes |
| 20 | [Consensus Algorithm](#consensus-algorithm) | Agree on values in distributed systems |

## Key Patterns

### Actor Model
**Intent**: Isolate state within actors that communicate only through message passing.

**Benefits**:
- No shared mutable state
- Natural fault isolation
- Location transparency
- Scalable concurrency

### Compare-and-Swap (CAS)
**Intent**: Atomically update a value only if it matches an expected value.

**Use Cases**:
- Lock-free data structures
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Atomic counters
