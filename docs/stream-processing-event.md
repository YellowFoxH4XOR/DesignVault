## Key Patterns

### Event Streaming
**Intent**: Create continuous, real-time flow of events that can be consumed by multiple downstream systems.

**Components**:
- **Event Producers**: Generate events
- **Event Brokers**: Route and persist events (Kafka, Pulsar)
- **Event Consumers**: Process events in real-time

**When to Use**:
- Real-time data pipeline needs
- Microservices communication
- Event-driven architectures
- Analytics and monitoring systems

### Windowing
**Intent**: Group events into time-based or count-based windows for processing.

**Window Types**:
- **Tumbling**: Fixed-size, non-overlapping windows
- **Sliding**: Fixed-size, overlapping windows
- **Session**: Variable-size windows based on activity gaps

**Example**:
```java
// Apache Kafka Streams windowing example
KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> wordCounts = textLines
    .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
    .groupBy((key, value) -> value)
    .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
    .count();
```

### Complex Event Processing (CEP)
**Intent**: Detect patterns and relationships across multiple events in real-time.

**Pattern Types**:
- **Sequence**: Events must occur in specific order
- **Conjunction**: Multiple events must occur within timeframe
- **Disjunction**: Any of several events must occur
- **Negation**: Event must NOT occur within timeframe

### Change Data Capture (CDC)
**Intent**: Capture and stream database changes as events for real-time processing.

**Approaches**:
- **Log-based**: Read database transaction logs
- **Trigger-based**: Use database triggers to capture changes
- **Timestamp-based**: Poll for changes based on timestamps
- **Snapshot-based**: Periodic full table snapshots

## Stream Processing Architectures

### Lambda Architecture
- **Batch Layer**: Process complete datasets
- **Speed Layer**: Process real-time streams
- **Serving Layer**: Merge batch and stream results

### Kappa Architecture
- **Stream-only**: Process all data as streams
- **Reprocessing**: Handle corrections through replay
- **Simpler**: Single processing paradigm

## Implementation Guidelines

### Choosing Stream Processing Frameworks
- **Apache Kafka Streams**: Java-based, exactly-once semantics
- **Apache Flink**: Low latency, complex event processing
- **Apache Storm**: Real-time, tuple-based processing
- **Apache Pulsar**: Multi-tenant, geo-distributed

### Best Practices
- **Idempotent Processing**: Handle duplicate events gracefully
- **Backpressure Handling**: Manage slow consumers
- **Schema Evolution**: Plan for event schema changes
- **Monitoring**: Track lag, throughput, and errors

### Common Patterns
- **Fan-out**: One event triggers multiple processes
- **Fan-in**: Multiple events combine into one result
- **Filter-Transform**: Clean and enrich events
- **Aggregate-Alert**: Monitor for threshold breaches
