Each pattern follows a consistent structure:
- **Intent** - What problem does this pattern solve?
- **Context** - When should you use this pattern?
- **Solution** - How does the pattern work?
- **Structure** - Architectural diagrams and components
- **Implementation** - Code examples and best practices
- **Consequences** - Trade-offs and considerations
- **Related Patterns** - Connections to other patterns
