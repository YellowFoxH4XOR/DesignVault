## Key Patterns

### Raft Consensus
**Intent**: Achieve consensus in distributed systems through leader election and log replication.

**Components**:
- **Leader**: Handles all client requests and log replication
- **Followers**: Replicate leader's log entries
- **Candidates**: Nodes attempting to become leader

**Phases**:
1. **Leader Election**: Select a leader through voting
2. **Log Replication**: Leader replicates entries to followers
3. **Safety**: Ensure committed entries persist

### Paxos Consensus
**Intent**: Achieve consensus even when nodes fail or messages are lost.

**Roles**:
- **Proposers**: Propose values
- **Acceptors**: Accept or reject proposals
- **Learners**: Learn the chosen value

**Phases**:
1. **Prepare**: Proposer requests promise from majority
2. **Accept**: Proposer asks acceptors to accept value
3. **Commit**: Value is chosen when majority accepts

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
**Intent**: Maintain system correctness even when some nodes behave arbitrarily (malicious or faulty).

**Requirements**:
- Need 3f+1 nodes to tolerate f Byzantine failures
- Cryptographic signatures for message authentication
- Multiple communication rounds for agreement

## Consensus Algorithms Comparison

| Algorithm | Fault Model | Performance | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Raft | Crash failures | High | Medium |
| Paxos | Crash failures | Medium | High |
| PBFT | Byzantine failures | Low | Very High |

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use Advanced Patterns
- **Consensus algorithms**: When strong consistency is required
- **Byzantine tolerance**: In adversarial environments
- **Vector clocks**: For causal consistency tracking
- **Clock-bound wait**: In globally distributed systems

### Trade-offs
- Performance vs consistency guarantees
- Simplicity vs fault tolerance
- Latency vs throughput
