## Key Patterns

### Smart Contract
**Intent**: Execute agreements automatically when predefined conditions are met.

**Characteristics**:
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed once deployed
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Autonomous**: Execute without intermediaries
- **Transparent**: Code is publicly verifiable

### Consensus Mechanism
**Intent**: Achieve agreement on the state of the distributed ledger across all nodes.

**Types**:
- **Proof of Work**: Solve computational puzzles
- **Proof of Stake**: Validate based on stake
- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Handle malicious nodes

### Oracle Pattern
**Intent**: Provide external data to smart contracts in a trustworthy manner.

**Challenges**:
- **Oracle Problem**: Trust in external data sources
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data hasn't been tampered with
- **Availability**: Reliable data feed

## Implementation Guidelines

### Blockchain Architecture Decisions
- **Public vs Private**: Open network vs restricted access
- **Permissioned vs Permissionless**: Who can participate
- **On-chain vs Off-chain**: What data goes on blockchain
- **Consensus Algorithm**: How to achieve agreement

### Smart Contract Best Practices
- **Security Audits**: Professional code review
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of correctness
- **Upgrade Patterns**: Plan for contract evolution
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimize transaction costs
