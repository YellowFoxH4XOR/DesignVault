## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (18+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/designvault.git
cd designvault
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm start
```

This starts a local development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

DesignVault includes automated GitHub Actions for deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. **Push to GitHub**: The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions  
3. **Auto-deploy**: Every push to `main` branch automatically deploys

See the [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 📖 Pattern Structure

Each pattern follows a consistent format:

- **Intent**: What problem does this pattern solve?
- **When to Use**: Specific scenarios and conditions
- **Structure**: Components and their relationships  
- **Implementation**: Code examples and best practices
- **Trade-offs**: Benefits and drawbacks
- **Related Patterns**: Connections to other patterns
